### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my profile. I'm Kikisito. I create custom Minecraft Spigot plugins, and at the moment I have a plugin, [NFCNotes](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/1-13-1-16-nfcnotes.449122/), published on SpigotMC.

I have some plugins thay may interest you. If you want to take a look, check my [repositories](https://github.com/Kikisito?tab=repositories).

If you want to contact me, you can email me at kikisito (at) edoras (dot) es. If you just want to report an issue or request a feature, open a ticket in the corresponding repository.
